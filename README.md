# My study projects

Here you can find my study projects. Unfortunately I wasn't uploading projects from the first and almost a half of the second semester.
All tasks are done to the maximum of points, but from today's point of view, I would definitely do them a little differently and improve the clarity of the code.

## Short description for each project

### JÄ™zyk i Techniki Programowania (JTP):
- **[zad_6](./zad_6)** 
  - The program reads figures from a file, displays them in a window, and then animates them in relation to a given point. Simple GUI start/stop and close buttons.
  - Stack: C++ with fltk 1.3.5 and graph_lib (wrapper around fltk). CMake as a project.
- **[zad_7](./zad_7)** 
  - Mostly GUI. Menu that changes the color and filling of the rectangle on the screen after clicking on the button.
  - Stack: C++ with fltk 1.3.5 and graph_lib (wrapper around fltk). CMake as a project.
- **[zad_8](./zad_8)** 
  - A program that reads a bitmap, applies a median filter to it, and then saves the finished filtered bitmap to the file.
  - Stack: C++. CMake as a project.
- **[zad_9](./zad_9)** 
  - The program reads the number and then encodes it in the EAN-8 system and saves it to a file in the BMP format as a barcode.
  - Stack: C++. CMake as a project.
